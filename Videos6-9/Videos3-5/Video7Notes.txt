DOM Events
Whenever the state of the component changes that component is going to re-render the template to the DOM to reflect that change in the browser.

Changing State
This keyword within render method represents the current instance of the App class by which we can access all methods and variables of the App class.
The arrow functions have a special behavior when it comes to this keyword. They bind the value of this(inside the function) to whatever this is outside the function. Whatever the value of this is outside the handleClick function is the component instance which is then bound to the methods by the arrow functions. 

Intro to forms
Since all websites have user inputs in some way, shape or form we are going to see how to create a form and get the UI data using react. 
1-We have deleted the components from the html template that we created in previous videos . The state remains the same as before and the output of the state is displayed in the <h1> tag.
2-to create a form enclose a <form> tag that takes in a single user input (their name) and updates the state on the fly where we output it as they type in. On click of the submit button it will log their name on the console.
3.add an event called onChange to the <input> tag that handles the event when there is change to the input text box as the user enters or deletes a value.
4. add an onSubmit event handler to the <form> tag to handle the event when the user  hits enter or submits the input value.
Add a method called handleSubmit to do the submit operation inside it that handles the onSubmit event.
